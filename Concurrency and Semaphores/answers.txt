1. Does your program run the same way each time? Why?
	The program does not run the same way each time. Generally the lowest number comes first, but not always. I think it is because of the multi-threading. There are no logic sequence between the threads and they catch and release semaphores which means the threads have to wait. 

2. Give your last customer thread the highest priority. Does this ensure that this customer is always given first priority? Why or why not?
	No, it doesn't ensure that the the last customer is given first priority because if the lower priority thread has the semaphore, that last customer will have to wait for that semaphore.
