		<h1>The Social Dilemma</h1>
		<q>If you're not paying for the product, then you are the product.</q>

			This statement gave me goosebumps. I always thought myself as a consumer, never once I thought myself as a product. Last semester, in data 101 class we watched a documentary on data science. One thing I remember about it was that social media is not free because while we are getting the service and using the platform for “free”, our information is being stored, analyzed and sold to other organization. However, <cite>The Social Dilemma</cite> goes on further and states that <em>we</em> are the product. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The common topic that all characters (Tristan Harris, Jaron Lanier, Roger Mcnamee, Aza Raskin, and Shoshana) focus on is surveillance capitalism. Our information being sold is not the main concern in this documentary. The real problem is that our data is used to increase our screen time on the certain platform by constantly posting advertisements and recommendations accordingly. This is scary because it seems to be true based on from my experience. Many times, during homework or study session, I tend to take a break on my social media like YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram. Before the break, I set mental time limit saying I am only going to do it for 10-15 minutes, but then most of the time I end up being online for more than 30 minutes. If worse, I would forget about my work because all the newsfeed, all the recommendations, and all stories interest me making me want more of them.

			Not only that, but tags are the same reason. If the user is offline, an alarm is sent so that the user can enter the interface. Therefore, companies allow people to increase interactions and increase usage time by tagging each other. Same as tags, I think notifications are used, too. After watching the movie, I see better what the platforms are doing to attract the user. Taking Facebook as an example, when a friend posted an update, a notification is sent. When an admin update anything in a group you are in, a notification is sent. When a friend was at a certain location, a notification is sent. It sends notifications reminding birthdays (even your own), anniversaries with friends on Facebook, events that friends are going to, new videos from pages, someone being on live, and new voting information center alert. Facebook is throwing a bait at us to use Facebook with useless notifications. Once we get on Facebook, it bombards us with new videos or posts that we might be interested and holds us there. I always wondered why Facebook sends so many useless notifications, but now I feel like I know why and I think everyone else should know, too.

			It is true that we were being swayed by technology that is developing exponentially even at this moment. Unlike the technology, human brain remains the same. We may think we are smart, but it does not compare of tens of thousands of computers. Thus, it is essential for us to be aware and to cultivate the ability to control and hold ourselves from blindly following the algorithm. 
		</p>
		<p>Here is the list of plausible things that I can try and will try to bring myself out of the algorithm swamp:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Set time limit on phone per day or per week.</li>
		  <li>Turn off all social media alarms (News, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, Mail, etc) on certain time period.</li>
		  <li>Search and view the desired video without viewing the recommended video.</li>
		  <li>Check the source and facts before sharing the news.</li>
		  <li>Trying to hear a variety of opinions rather than one opinion.</li>
		  <li>Get away from any electronic devices at least 30 minutes before sleeping.</li>
		</ul>  
		<p>
			The documentary is well made. It leaves us with many factors to think about. Of course, the examples presented in the documentary are true. However, I think there are some extend of exaggeration in it. Since the topic of negative issues of the social media was initially set as a topic, for typical users who only look at the positive side and who are addicted to social media and unable to think rationally, it would be very difficult to accept all these negative consequences of social media. I believe a large number of users have the ability to think right. However, if some of the people who use these platforms cause problems that directly harm others, there should be social media regulation provided by the society. Of course, Facebook, Instagram, Google, Twitter, Reddit, etc. are all aware of the fault enough to hire staff to manage post quality and AI development necessary for platform management, but I believe there should be more monitors to check the directions and values of such companies from time to time. And again, it is hard to measure how social media is directly involved in making harm.

			But again, it is hard to measure how social media is directly involved in the harms. I believe that the consequences of social media are fatal problems and it should be treated as crucial as the virus that caused problems in society. Its consequences may seem to be indirect and subtle compared to real viruses, but with increasing number of radical events, spread of fake news leading to cause physical problems, I think some kind of regulation or education to prevent or raise awareness is required. You may think that deceived people are dumb, but after being exposed to the same information multiple times, you have no choice but to believe it. It has an effect of brainwashing which is why it is dangerous.

			At first, I thought one thousand words is a lot and it will take a long time for me to think about what I should write to fill up one thousand words. Surprisingly it was not that hard to fill the page reflecting on the movie. If social media occupies a high percentage of your mobile phone screen time, I would strongly recommend watching this documentary. Even if you are so into social media and you think you cannot go back, it is okay. This documentary gives you a chance to think seriously about this topic. If this documentary leaves you with the slightest awareness in the corner of your mind, I think it is worth seeing. I personally think this is a required social media education for all age group. I am glad that I got to watch through this class.
